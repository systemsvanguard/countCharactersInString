# Count the Characters in a String

Simple Python script to count the characters in a string of text.  For example, string **aaabbdcccccf** should yield ***a3b2d1c5f1*** . Similarly, string **hhhhhqqlllllllhhhppp** should yield ***h5q2l7h3p3*** BUT NOT ***h8q2l7p3***.  I have not finished fixing the code to do that 2nd requirement properly as yet.  I am out of time now.  Will revisit later.
